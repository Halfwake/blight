Blight
======

Blight is a GUI Tox client written in Racket that utilizes libtoxcore-racket.
In very early pre-alpha stage. If you can, please help out!

P.S. The versioning thing with libtoxcore-racket only accounts for the way
Racket handles the directory hierarchy for packages. The files themselves are
identical.
