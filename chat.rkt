 # two ways (so far) to go about sending a message, graphically:
 # use editor-canvas%, which is pretty, but not as yet obviously
 # function as text-field%, second is text-field%, which is
 # functional, but not as pretty as editor-canvas%
 #
 # issues:
 # - still needs to send when user presses enter
 #   as well as needs functionality for Shift-Enter
