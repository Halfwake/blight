 # two ways (so far) to go about sending a message, graphically:
 # use editor-canvas%, which is pretty, but not as yet obviously
 # function as text-field%, second is text-field%, which is
 # functional, but not as pretty as editor-canvas%
 #
 # issues:
 # - cannot figure out how to clear text from canvas
 # - default text for canvas% is preserved on resizing the window,
 #   which might be because of (send canvas on-draw).
 # - sending a new draw-text to canvas doesn't replace the default
 #   text, simply appears underneath the old.
